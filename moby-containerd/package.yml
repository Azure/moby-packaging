  Industry-standard container runtime
   containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
   simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux
   and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host
   system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision,
   low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
   .
   containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being
   used directly by developers or end-users.
