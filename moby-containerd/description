Industry-standard container runtime
 containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux
 and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host
 system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision,
 low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being
 used directly by developers or end-users.
